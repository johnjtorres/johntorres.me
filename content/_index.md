Hey, my name is John Torres and I am currently working as a Network Security Engineer. I built this site to house my ramblings on various technology topics.

See what I'm up to on [GitHub](https://github.com/johnjtorres) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/johnjamestorres), or shoot me an [email](mailto:john@johntorres.me) if you want to say hi.
